I was thinking it would be interesting to be able to pull references from bibliography of a paper and create maps out of them.

Ideally, I imagine it would be cool to have a system where if you publish a paper all of your references get logged and a map is created. I also imagine GoogleScholar already has a map of this sort, but it seems they're not too interested in providing any graphical tools to help analyse your field of research.

I'm using a hodge-podge of methods myself:

1. I pull bibliographies with [Cermine](http://cermine.ceon.pl/i) or [Anystyle](https://anystyle.io)
2. I distribute the general file into smaller markdown files using the python code in this repo
3. I upload the folder to my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault to create the visual maps

I'll try to upgrade the functionality as time goes on.
